# SQL Challenge

**Purpose**: The purpose of this repo is to host the answers to [Danny Ma's 8 week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/).

**Status**: In Progress

There are eight SQL challenge case studies. Each case study will have two notebooks: one with the code to create the SQLite databases needed to answer the case study question and another notebook with the solutions. Although these are python notebooks, they execute SQL queries on the sqlite databases.
