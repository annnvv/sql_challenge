# SQL Challenge

**Purpose**: The purpose of this repo is to host the answers to [Danny Ma's 8 week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/getting-started/).

**Status**: In Progress

There are eight SQL challenge case studies. Each case study will have two notebooks: one with the code to create the SQLite databases needed to answer the case study question and another notebook with the solutions. Although these are python notebooks, they execute SQL queries on the sqlite databases.

Why choose SQLite as the database for these challenges:
- SQLite is simple and has basic features. 
- SQLite is relatively fast.
- SQLite has a small set-up size (which means small file size for the db). 
- SQLite is portable (it's easy to move it to different directories if necessary and is stored in a cross-platform format). 
- SQLite is a serverless DBMS.
- I only need access to the database (others can re-create it from code if necessary). 
- The data doesn't require security features or authentication.
